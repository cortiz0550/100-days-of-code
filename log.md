# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created the 404 and 500 error pages, created the Posts model so I can start storing blog posts, and created the routes/errorhandlers to the main file.

**Thoughts:** I found that at times I was really trying to figure out what my next step was. I ended up grabbing my Flask book and looking up the database integration chapter, but I think from now on I will go to the documentation of these modules when looking at how to implement them. This way I am not just copying text without knowing what it does.


### Day 1: February 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished connecting the db to the website. I also read through how to create the database and made the first table that will hold all of the posts.

**Thoughts:** I struggled trying to adjust how to order the posts in the database in order to have them appear on the homepage in reverse order. I figured it out though after learning about the desc() function in sqlAlchemy.


### Day 2: February 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: I added bootstrap to the app so that it would start to look a little nicer. It took a while for me to go through the bootstrap, wtform docs to figure out how to change the templates. Ended up getting an idea of it, but still not 100% sure why it works the way it does.

**Thoughts:** I think I will have to start setting up the app in a more user friendly fashion. Having it in one file is nice, but I see how it could be better organized by breaking it up. I am not sure how I will do that, but I'll figure it out. It felt good today. A lot of struggling but I feel good. I do have to figure out why Bootstrap spacing is all weird though.
