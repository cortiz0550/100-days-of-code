# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Created the 404 and 500 error pages, created the Posts model so I can start storing blog posts, and created the routes/errorhandlers to the main file.

**Thoughts:** I found that at times I was really trying to figure out what my next step was. I ended up grabbing my Flask book and looking up the database integration chapter, but I think from now on I will go to the documentation of these modules when looking at how to implement them. This way I am not just copying text without knowing what it does.
